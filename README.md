# Media Querie Challenge

## Scope:
In this challenge, using a mobile-first approach, I made a webpage responsive in line with the following guidelines:

- Make the div elements 30% of the window size. Now make this change only for the devices that are wider than or equal to 992px
- Set the margin to 10px on all sides for each column for the devices that are wider than or equal to 992px
- Keep the full-size width for the devices below the 992px
- Remove the left and right margin for the devices below the 992px

## Feedback 
I found this challenge pretty straight forward, although it has become apparent to me that the ordering of media queries is very important
